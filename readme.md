# Plugin Dev Environment

This is my setup for developing new features and fixing bugs for Robot Framework and InfluxDB plugins

## Directory structure

```
./docker-compose.yml
./grafana/
./influxdb/
    config.conf
./influxdb2/
    config.yml
./postgres/
./robot/
./sonarqube/
~/docker-jenkins/latest/jenkins
```

Jenkins workspace is in a different location for legacy reasons.
